	<LongDescription>
This mod allows you to easily change the capacity of school buildings based on their education level (elementary, high school, college, and university).


The mod uses these pre-set values by default (values relative to vanilla capacities):

* Elementary -> 200%
* High School -> 100% (unchanged)
* College -> 125%
* University -> 125%


You can also change these values yourself in the settings.
